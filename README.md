Creating a demo to visualize and showcase each of Airwallex's products.

Work in progress :)

---------------------------

Backend:
navigate to `backend` folder and run `npm install` and `node server.js`

Frontend:
On the root directory run `npm install` and `npm start`

If you want to use a different connected account update the `onBehalfOfAccountId` in `backend/config.json` and `src/config.json`
